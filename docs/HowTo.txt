Definitions
-----------
Some important defitions may be helpful for beginners.

 * **Dialog** is a window containing several other GUI elements/controls like
   buttons, edit boxes etc. Dialog is not necessarily a main window. Message
   box on top of main form is also a dialog. Main form is also considered a
   dialog by pywinauto.
 * A control is GUI element at any level of a hierarchy. This definition
   includes window, button, edit box, grid, grid cell, bar etc.
 * Win32 API technology ("win32" backend in pywinauto) provides an identifier
   for every control. This is a unique integer called **handle**.
 * UI Automation API ("uia" backend in pywinauto) may not provide window
   **handle** for every GUI element. Such an element is not visible to
   "win32" backend. But ``Inspect.exe`` can show property ``NativeWindowHandle``
   if it's available.


How to specify a usable Application instance
---------------------------------------------
An ``Application()`` instance is the point of contact for all work
with the application you are automating. So the Application instance needs
to be connected to a process. There are two ways of doing this:

  ::

    start(self, cmd_line, timeout=app_start_timeout)  # instance method:

or:

  ::

    connect(self, **kwargs)  # instance method:

``start()`` is used when the application is not running and you
need to start it. Use it in the following way:

  ::

   app = Application().start(r"c:\path\to\your\application -a -n -y --arguments")

The timeout parameter is optional, it should only be necessary to use
if the application takes a long time to start up.

``connect()`` is used when the application to be automated is already
launched. To specify an already running application you need to specify
one of the following:

:process: the process id of the application, e.g.

  ::

              app = Application().connect(process=2341)


:handle: The windows handle of a window of the application, e.g.

  ::

              app = Application().connect(handle=0x010f0c)


:path: The path of the executable of the process (``GetModuleFileNameEx``
  is used to find the path of each process and compared against
  the value passed in)  e.g.

  ::

          app = Application().connect(path=r"c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe")


or any combination of the parameters that specify a window, these get
passed to the :func:`pywinauto.findwindows.find_elements()` function.  e.g.

  ::

          app = Application().connect(title_re=".*Notepad", class_name="Notepad")


**Note**: The application has to be ready before you can use connect*().
There is no timeout or retries like there is when finding the application
after start(). So if you start the application outside of pywinauto you
need to either sleep or program a wait loop to wait until the application
has fully started.


How to specify a dialog of the application
------------------------------------------
Once the application instance knows what application it is connected to
a dialog to work on needs to be specified.

There are many different ways of doing this. The most common will be
using item or attribute access to select a dialog based on it's title. e.g

  ::

   dlg = app.Notepad

or equivalently

  ::

   dlg = app['Notepad']

The next easiest method is to ask for the ``top_window()`` e.g.

  ::

    dlg = app.top_window()

This will return the window that has the highest Z-Order of the top-level
windows of the application.

**Note**: This is currently fairly untested so I am not sure it will
return the correct window. It will definitely be a top level window of
the application - it just might not be the one highest in the Z-Order.

If this is not enough control then you can use the same parameters as
can be passed to ``findwindows.find_windows()`` e.g.

  ::

    dlg = app.window(title_re="Page Setup", class_name="#32770")

Finally to have the most control you can use

  ::

    dialogs = app.windows()

this will return a list of all the visible, enabled, top level windows
of the application. You can then use some of the methods in ``handleprops``
module select the dialog you want. Once you have the handle you need
then use

  ::

    app.window(handle=win)

**Note**: If the title of the dialog is very long - then attribute access
might be very long to type, in those cases it is usually easier to use

  ::

    app.window(title_re=".*Part of Title.*")



How to specify a control on a dialog
------------------------------------

There are a number of ways to specify a control, the simplest are

  ::

   app.dlg.control
   app['dlg']['control']


The 2nd is better for non English OS's where you need to pass unicode
strings e.g. ``app[u'your dlg title'][u'your ctrl title']``

The code builds up multiple identifiers for each control from the following:

 - title
 - friendly class
 - title + friendly class

If the control's title text is empty (after removing non char characters) this text is
not used. Instead we look for the closest title text above and to the right of
the control. And append the friendly class. So the list becomes

 - friendly class
 - closest text + friendly class

Once a set of identifiers has been created for all controls in the dialog
we disambiguate them.

use the `WindowSpecification.print_control_identifiers()` method

e.g. 
  ::

   app.YourDialog.print_control_identifiers()

    Static -    (L1466, T586, R1557, B594)
            'Static' 'BottomStatic'

This example has been taken from test_application.py

**Note** The identifiers printed by this method have been run through
the process that makes the identifier unique. So if you have two edit boxes,
they will both have "Edit" listed in their identifiers. In reality though
the first one can be refered to as "Edit", "Edit0", "Edit1" and the 2nd
should be refered to as "Edit2"

**Note** You do not have to be exact!. Say we take an instance from the
example above

  ::

    Button - Margins (inches)   (L1183, T493, R1411, B584)
            'Marginsinches' 'MarginsinchesGroupBox' 'GroupBox'

Let's say that you don't like any of these

  - ``GroupBox`` - too generic, it could be any group box
  - ``Marginsinches`` and ``MarginsinchesGroupBox`` - these just don'
    look right, it would be nicer to leave out the 'inches' part

Well you CAN! The code does a best match on the identifer you use against
all the available identifiers in the dialog.

For example if you break into the debugger you can see how different
identifiers can be used

  ::

    (Pdb) print app.PageSetup.Margins.window_text()
    Margins (inches)
    (Pdb) print app.PageSetup.MarginsGroupBox.window_text()
    Margins (inches)


And this will also cater for typos. Though you still have to be careful
as if there are 2 similar identifiers in the dialog the typo you have
used might be more similar to another control then the one you were
thinking of.

How to use pywinauto with application languages other than English
------------------------------------------------------------------
Because Python does not support unicode identifiers in code
you cannot use attribute access to reference a control so
you would either have to use item access or make an explicit
calls to ``window()``.

So instead of writing

  ::

   app.dialog_ident.control_ident.click()

You would have to write

  ::

    app['dialog_ident']['control_ident'].click()

Or use ``window()`` explictly

  ::

    app.window(title_re="NonAsciiCharacters").window(title="MoreNonAsciiCharacters").click()

To see an example of this check ``examples\misc_examples.py get_info()``



How to deal with controls that do not respond as expected (e.g. OwnerDraw Controls)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some controls (especially Ownerdrawn controls) do not respond to events as
expected. For example if you look at any HLP file and go to the Index Tab (click
'Search' button) you will see a listbox. Running Spy or Winspector on this
will show you that it is indeed a list box - but it is ownerdrawn. This means
that the developer has told Windows that they will override how items are displayed
and do it themselves. And in this case they have made it so that strings cannot be
retrieved :-(.

So what problems does this cause? 

  ::

   app.HelpTopics.ListBox.texts()                # 1
   app.HelpTopics.ListBox.select("ItemInList")   # 2


1. Will return a list of empty strings, all this means is that pywinauto has not
   been able to get the strings in the listbox

2. This will fail with an IndexError because the select(string) method of a ListBox
   looks for the item in the Texts to know the index of the item that it should select.

The following workaround will work on this control 

  ::

   app.HelpTopics.ListBox.select(1)

This will select the 2nd item in the listbox, because it is not a string lookup
it works correctly.

Unfortunately not even this will always work. The developer can make it so that the
control does not respond to standard events like Select. In this case the only way
you can select items in the listbox is by using the keyboard simulation of TypeKeys().

This allows you to send any keystrokes to a control. So to select the 3rd item you
would use

  ::

   app.Helptopics.ListBox1.type_keys("{HOME}{DOWN 2}{ENTER}")


- ``{HOME}`` will make sure that the first item is highlighted.
- ``{DOWN 2}`` will then move the highlight down two items
- ``{ENTER}`` will select the highlighted item

If your application made an extensive use of a similar control type then you could
make using it easier by deriving a new class from ListBox, that could use extra
knowledge about your particular application. For example in the WinHelp example
every time an item is highlighted in the list view, its text is inserted into the
Edit control above the list, and you CAN get the text of the item from there e.g. 

  ::

   # print the text of the item currently selected in the list box
   # (as long as you are not typing into the Edit control!)
   print app.HelpTopics.Edit.texts()[1]


How to Access the System Tray (aka SysTray, aka 'Notification Area')
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Near the clock there are icons representing running applications, this area is
normally referred to as the "System Tray". In fact, there are many different
windows/controls in this area. The control that contains the icons is actually
a toolbar. It is a child of Pager control within a window with a class TrayNotifyWnd,
which is inside another window with a class Shell_TrayWnd and all these windows
are part of the running Explorer instance. Thankfully you don't need to remember
all that :-).

The thing that is important to remember is that you are looking for a
window in the "Explorer.exe" application with the class "Shell_TrayWnd" that has
Toolbar control with a title "Notification Area".

One way to get this is to do the following 

  ::

   import pywinauto.application
   app = pywinauto.application.Application().connect(path="explorer")
   systray_icons = app.ShellTrayWnd.NotificationAreaToolbar

The taskbar module provides very preliminary access to the System Tray.

It defines the following variables:

:explorer_app:  defines an Application() object connected to the running
                explorer. You probably don't need to use it directly
                very much.
:TaskBar:  The handle to the task bar (the bar containing Start Button,
           the QuickLaunch icons, running tasks, etc
:StartButton:  "Start me up" :-) I think you might know what this is!
:QuickLaunch: The Toolbar with the quick launch icons
:SystemTray: The window that contains the Clock and System Tray Icons
:Clock: The clock
:SystemTrayIcons:  The toolbar representing the system tray icons
:RunningApplications:  The toolbar representing the running applications

I have also provided two functions in the module that can be used to click on
system tray icons:

:``ClickSystemTrayIcon(button)``: You can use this to left click a visible icon
    in the system tray. I had to specifically say
    visible icon as there may be many invisible
    icons that obviously cannot be clicked. Button
    can be any integer. If you specify 3 then it will
    find and click the 3rd visible button. (Almost no
    error checking is performed now here but this method will
    more than likely be moved/renamed in the future.)

:``RightClickSystemTrayIcon(button)``: Similar to ``ClickSytemTrayIcon`` but 
 performs a right click.


Often, when you click/right click on an icon, you get a popup menu. The thing to
remember at this point is that the popup menu is a part of the application being
automated not part of explorer.

e.g.

  ::

    # connect to outlook
    outlook = Application.connect(path='outlook.exe')

    # click on Outlook's icon
    taskbar.ClickSystemTrayIcon("Microsoft Outlook")

    # Select an item in the popup menu
    outlook.PopupMenu.Menu().get_menu_path("Cancel Server Request")[0].click()



COM Threading Model
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, pywinauto sets up the client Multithreading COM model (MTA) on init if
no other model was defined prior to import of pywinauto. The model can be set up by
another imported module implicitly or specified explicitly through ``sys.coinit_flags``.

Example for overriding MTA by setting the single threaded appartment model explicitly.

  ::

   import sys
   sys.coinit_flags = 2  # COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED
   
   import pywinauto


Notice that the final value of COM model is assigned back to ``sys.coinit_flags``.
This is to avoid conflicts with other modules. Possible values for ``sys.coinit_flags``:

- ``0`` - Multi-Threaded Apartment model (MTA)
- ``2`` - Single-Threaded Apartment model (STA)
