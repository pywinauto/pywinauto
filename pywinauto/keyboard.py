r"""Keyboard input emulation module

Automate typing keys or individual key actions (viz. press and hold, release) to
an active window by calling ``send_keys`` method.

You can use any Unicode characters (on Windows) and some special keys listed
below. The module is also available on Linux.

**Available key codes:** ::

    {SCROLLLOCK}, {VK_SPACE}, {VK_LSHIFT}, {VK_PAUSE}, {VK_MODECHANGE},
    {BACK}, {VK_HOME}, {F23}, {F22}, {F21}, {F20}, {VK_HANGEUL}, {VK_KANJI},
    {VK_RIGHT}, {BS}, {HOME}, {VK_F4}, {VK_ACCEPT}, {VK_F18}, {VK_SNAPSHOT},
    {VK_PA1}, {VK_NONAME}, {VK_LCONTROL}, {ZOOM}, {VK_ATTN}, {VK_F10}, {VK_F22},
    {VK_F23}, {VK_F20}, {VK_F21}, {VK_SCROLL}, {TAB}, {VK_F11}, {VK_END},
    {LEFT}, {VK_UP}, {NUMLOCK}, {VK_APPS}, {PGUP}, {VK_F8}, {VK_CONTROL},
    {VK_LEFT}, {PRTSC}, {VK_NUMPAD4}, {CAPSLOCK}, {VK_CONVERT}, {VK_PROCESSKEY},
    {ENTER}, {VK_SEPARATOR}, {VK_RWIN}, {VK_LMENU}, {VK_NEXT}, {F1}, {F2},
    {F3}, {F4}, {F5}, {F6}, {F7}, {F8}, {F9}, {VK_ADD}, {VK_RCONTROL},
    {VK_RETURN}, {BREAK}, {VK_NUMPAD9}, {VK_NUMPAD8}, {RWIN}, {VK_KANA},
    {PGDN}, {VK_NUMPAD3}, {DEL}, {VK_NUMPAD1}, {VK_NUMPAD0}, {VK_NUMPAD7},
    {VK_NUMPAD6}, {VK_NUMPAD5}, {DELETE}, {VK_PRIOR}, {VK_SUBTRACT}, {HELP},
    {VK_PRINT}, {VK_BACK}, {CAP}, {VK_RBUTTON}, {VK_RSHIFT}, {VK_LWIN}, {DOWN},
    {VK_HELP}, {VK_NONCONVERT}, {BACKSPACE}, {VK_SELECT}, {VK_TAB}, {VK_HANJA},
    {VK_NUMPAD2}, {INSERT}, {VK_F9}, {VK_DECIMAL}, {VK_FINAL}, {VK_EXSEL},
    {RMENU}, {VK_F3}, {VK_F2}, {VK_F1}, {VK_F7}, {VK_F6}, {VK_F5}, {VK_CRSEL},
    {VK_SHIFT}, {VK_EREOF}, {VK_CANCEL}, {VK_DELETE}, {VK_HANGUL}, {VK_MBUTTON},
    {VK_NUMLOCK}, {VK_CLEAR}, {END}, {VK_MENU}, {SPACE}, {BKSP}, {VK_INSERT},
    {F18}, {F19}, {ESC}, {VK_MULTIPLY}, {F12}, {F13}, {F10}, {F11}, {F16},
    {F17}, {F14}, {F15}, {F24}, {RIGHT}, {VK_F24}, {VK_CAPITAL}, {VK_LBUTTON},
    {VK_OEM_CLEAR}, {VK_ESCAPE}, {UP}, {VK_DIVIDE}, {INS}, {VK_JUNJA},
    {VK_F19}, {VK_EXECUTE}, {VK_PLAY}, {VK_RMENU}, {VK_F13}, {VK_F12}, {LWIN},
    {VK_DOWN}, {VK_F17}, {VK_F16}, {VK_F15}, {VK_F14}

    ~ is a shorter alias for {ENTER}

**Modifiers:**

- ``'+': {VK_SHIFT}``
- ``'^': {VK_CONTROL}``
- ``'%': {VK_MENU}`` a.k.a. Alt key

Example how to use modifiers: ::

    send_keys('^a^c') # select all (Ctrl+A) and copy to clipboard (Ctrl+C)
    send_keys('+{INS}') # insert from clipboard (Shift+Ins)
    send_keys('%{F4}') # close an active window with Alt+F4

Repetition count can be specified for special keys. ``{ENTER 2}`` says to
press Enter twice.

Example which shows how to press and hold or release a key on the keyboard: ::

    send_keys("{VK_SHIFT down}"
              "pywinauto"
              "{VK_SHIFT up}") # to type PYWINAUTO

    send_keys("{h down}"
              "{e down}"
              "{h up}"
              "{e up}"
              "llo") # to type hello

Use curly brackers to escape modifiers and type reserved symbols as single keys: ::

    send_keys('{^}a{^}c{%}') # type string "^a^c%" (Ctrl will not be pressed)
    send_keys('{{}ENTER{}}') # type string "{ENTER}" without pressing Enter key

For Windows only, pywinauto defaults to sending a virtual key packet
(VK_PACKET) for textual input.  For applications that do not handle VK_PACKET
appropriately, the ``vk_packet`` option may be set to ``False``.  In this case
pywinauto will attempt to send the virtual key code of the requested key.  This
option only affects the behavior of keys matching [-=[]\;',./a-zA-Z0-9 ].  Note
that upper and lower case are included for a-z.  Both reference the same
virtual key for convenience.
