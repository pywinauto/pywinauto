"""ComboBox dropped height Test

**What is checked**
It is ensured that the height of the list displayed when the combobox is
dropped down is not less than the height of the reference.

**How is it checked**
The value for the dropped rectangle can be retrieved from windows. The height
of this rectangle is calculated and compared against the reference height.

**When is a bug reported**
If the height of the dropped rectangle for the combobox being checked is less
than the height of the reference one then a bug is reported.

**Bug Extra Information**
There is no extra information associated with this bug type

**Is Reference dialog needed**
The reference dialog is necessary for this test.

**False positive bug reports**
No false bugs should be reported. If the font of the localised control has a
smaller height than the reference then it is possible that the dropped
rectangle could be of a different size.

**Test Identifier**
The identifier for this test/bug is "ComboBoxDroppedHeight"
