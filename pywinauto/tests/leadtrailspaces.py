"""Different Leading and Trailing Spaces Test

**What is checked**
Checks that the same space characters (<space>, <tab>, <enter>, <vertical tab>)
are before and after all non space characters in the title of the control when
compared to the reference control.

**How is it checked**
Find the 1st non-space character, and the characters of the title up to that
are the leading spaces.
Find the last non-space character, and the characters of the title after that
are the trailing spaces.
These are then compared to the lead and trail spaces from the reference
control and if they are not exactly the then a bug is reported.

**When is a bug reported**
When either the leading or trailing spaces of the control being tested does
not match the equivalent spaces of the reference control exactly.

**Bug Extra Information**
The bug contains the following extra information

  * **Lead-Trail**  Whether this bug report is for the leading or
    trailing spaces of the control, String

    This will be either:

      - "Leading"  bug relating to leading spaces
      - "Trailing"  bug relating to trailing spaces

  * **Ref**  The leading or trailings spaces of the reference string
    (depending on Lead-Trail value), String
  * **Loc**  The leading or trailings spaces of the local string (depending on
    Lead-Trail value), String

**Is Reference dialog needed**
This test will not run if the reference controls are not available.

**False positive bug reports**
This is usually not a very important test, so if it generates many false
positives then we should consider removing it.

**Test Identifier**
The identifier for this test/bug is "LeadTrailSpaces"
