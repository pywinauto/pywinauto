"""Different number of special character sequences Test

**What is checked**
This test checks to make sure that certain special character sequences
appear the in the localised if they appear in the reference title strings.
These strings usually mean something to the user but the software internally
does not care if they exist or not. The list that is currently checked is:
">>", ">", "<<", "<", ":"(colon), "...", "&&", "&", ""

**How is it checked**
For each of the string to check for we make sure that if it appears in the
reference that it also appears in the localised title.

**When is a bug reported**
 - If the reference has one of the text strings but the localised does
   not a bug is reported.
 - If the localised has one of the text strings but the reference does
   not a bug is reported.

Bug Extra Information
The bug contains the following extra information

**MissingOrExtra**	Whether the characters are missing or extra from the
controls being check as compared to the reference, (String with
following possible values)

 - "MissingCharacters"	The characters are in the reference but not in
   the localised.
 - "ExtraCharacters"	The characters are not in the reference but are in
   the localised.

**MissingOrExtraText**	What character string is missing or added, String

**Is Reference dialog needed**
This test will not run if the reference controls are not available.

**False positive bug reports**
Currently this test is at a beta stage filtering of the results is probably
necessary at the moment.

**Test Identifier**
The identifier for this test/bug is "MissingExtraString"
